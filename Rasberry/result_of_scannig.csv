  X11 is a client - server protocol. Basically, the server is in charge of the
  screen, and the clients connect to it and send several requests like drawing
  a window or a menu, and the server sends events back to the clients, such as
  mouse clicks, key strokes, and so on...

  An improperly configured X server will accept connections from clients from
  anywhere. This allows an attacker to make a client connect to the X server to
  record the keystrokes of the user, which may contain sensitive information,
  such as account passwords.
  This can be prevented by using xauth, MIT cookies, or preventing
  the X server from listening on TCP (a Unix sock is used for local
  connections)","Detected X Windows Server
